HW3_Calico_Tests
 -Test1
 -Test2
 -Test3

Each test consists of two repeat tests: calico_test.t and calico_test_sep.t. calico_test checks the output as a whole. In the calico_test_sep, the expected output was divided into different test cases. Then the output is sought and scored for each case separately. Therefore, calico_test is sharper than calico_test_sep in evaluation. I have used both tests to ensure you get score even if your program is not %100 correct. 

Your final HW3 grade is calculated by average of all tests.

How to run:
Assume that you are in HW3_Solution folder,

To remove old calico.log file if exist:
rm submission/solution_0000ibilgen/calico.log 

Run the test files:
calico -d "Submissions/andy" Data_Structures_HW3_Test1/calico_test.t --log
calico -d "Submissions/andy" Data_Structures_HW3_Test1/calico_test_sep.t --log
...
Apply same for the other test files.

To run the program:
Submissions/andy/hw3 Data_Structures_HW3_Test1/Network.txt Data_Structures_HW3_Test1/Messages.txt
